# Microservices

I have created a two microservices SchoolAdmission and SchoolAttendance which interact with each other using Ocelot.
I have also added docker files to convert these microservices to containerize these microservices, along with that we can also connect them within the the same network using docker-compose.
Note: This project doesen't contain any functionality it's just a dummy project to understand above concepts using boilerplate code and two additionally added endpoints.
